# Phase1 test list example
#
# Comments and whitespace are ignored.
#
# A single test is defined with the format:
#
#       name : timeout : command
#
# Where:
#       'name' is any arbitrary string used to identify the test, may not contain ":"
#       'seconds' is command timeout, must be > 0, but if blank the default is 60 seconds
#       'command' is a command to be executed by /bin/sh
#
# Loop blocks are defined as:
#
#    	count {
# 		name : timeout : commannd
#       	...
#    	}
#
# The tests in the block will be repeated 'count' time.
#
# Normally, testing stops at the first failure. This can be prevented with:
#
#	set IgnoreFail
#
# If a test fails it will be indicated as a failure but testing will continue.
# However the testing cannot proceed to the next phase.
#
# The tests here don't do anything interesting, they are just for
# demonstration and to fill the test log with stuff.
