# Phase1 test list example
#
# Comments and whitespace are ignored.
# One test per line, in the format:
#
#       name : timeout : command
#
# Where:
#       'name' is any arbitrary string used to identify the test, may not contain ":"
#       'seconds' is command timeout, must be > 0, but if blank the default is 60 seconds
#       'command' is a command to be executed by /bin/sh

# Phase1 must always permanently store the device ID somewhere platform-specific.
# For this example, we'll just write it to home directory.
Store DeviceID      :: case "$DEVICEID" in BYT*) echo $DEVICEID > ~/deviceid.txt;; *) echo "DeviceID '$DEVICEID' is invalid"; exit 1;; esac 

Some kind of test   :: set && sleep 1

Another test        :: ps auxf && sleep 1

Yet another test    :: ls -al && sleep 1
